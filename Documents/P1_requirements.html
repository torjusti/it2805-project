          <p id="profile-description">Our client is Thorleif Fluer Vikre. He owns and run the company Vikre Handel, which primarily deals with renting out and selling plastic warehouses. However, the business also branches out into the rental and sale of numerous other products. Our task is to create a website specifically aimed at selling gabions. Gabions are essentially metal crates you fill with various types of rocks, and stack to build decorative garden elements. Some examples are fences and benches.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>

        <p>The goal of the website is to sell gabions to both determined customers and undetermined customers. Therefore it is vital that the webpage is graphically pleasing in order to solidify the determined customer’s decision and to persuade undetermined customers. We intend to use a lot of pictures to bolster the webpage aesthetics.</p>

        <h3>Intended audience</h3>
        <p>The target group for the webpage for the most part consists of house owning couples, roughly 25 years and older, who want to use gabions on their property. The intended audience poses another challenge to our website, as many in this demographic are older, and thus not very experienced with computers. Due to this, our design should be fairly straightforward and simplistic. For instance, we should avoid hidden features such as dropdown menus and so forth. We should also emphasize readability when it comes to textual elements, as older users might find it strenuous to read if the text is too small, etc.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>Beside the certain requirements for the contents which will be discussed further down, we have free reign. When we discussed requirements with the client he stated that he had no requirements or preferences in regards to organization of the contents or design choices, besides it being an user friendly webpage with several pictures and some videos. Regardless, we will send several different suggestions to the client on crucial matters to make sure we are in agreement.</p>

        <p>We also have a couple very basic requirements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The webpage should utilize a lot of pictures.</li>
          <li>The webpage should utilize videos for instructional purposes.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Contents</h3>

        <p>Our initial plan is that the website will have five pages, but as we have free reign, if the need arises we might restructure small parts of the website if it seems beneficial.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Homepage
            <p>The home page will be devoted to different trivia and pictures of gabions. The trivia is supposed to catch the customers attention and hopefully make them interested in buying gabions. The pictures will serve multiple purposes. In addition to it being aesthetically pleasing, it will also inform customers who are not familiar with gabions of what they are.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Specifications
            <p>There are several variations of gabions. This is why we will create a specifications page to display the differences. The specifications page will help the user decide what model to buy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage examples
            <p>This page will display various ways of using gabions. It will consist of various paragraphs and pictures of gabions in different settings. We wish to inspire the customer to use gabions in their next garden project.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Tutorials
            <p>The hurdle of construction might seem intimidating at first. The construction page will be dedicated to guiding the customers through the process. This will hopefully help to sway fence-sitters.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            About us
            <p>It’s vital that the user has good access to contact information, as there will not be an online payment method for the foreseeable future. The about us page will contain various contact information in addition to other relevant information about the company.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Server and hosting</h3>
        <p>Thorleif is already in posession of the domain gabionbutikken.no, this will be the final destination for the webpage. Thorleif will provide the website hosting, and Kjell Østlid, an associate of Thorleif, will be maintaining the website..</p>
