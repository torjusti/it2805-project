          <p id="profile-description">Our client is Thorleif Fluer Vikre. He owns and run the company Vikre Handel, which primarily deals with renting out and selling plastic warehouses. However, the business also branches out into the rental and sale of numerous other products. Our task is to create a website specifically aimed at selling gabions. Gabions are essentially metal crates you fill with various types of rocks, and stack to build decorative garden elements. Some examples are fences and benches.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>

        <p>The goal of the website is to sell gabions to both determined customers and undetermined customers. Therefore it is vital that the webpage is graphically pleasing - a professional website helps built trust, a badly designed website might turn the user away. We intend to use a modern looking stylesheet, and to use carefully picked, good-quality pictures and slideshows. We also want the user to have good access to contact information, and the adress of the store facility, as online billing has been deemed out of scope for this project. The home page will inform the user about gabions, the specifications page will help the user decide which gabions to buy, and the contact page will help the user with constructing using the gabions. The hurdle of constructing the gabions might also seem intimidating at first, which is why we will implement instructions on how to construct the gabions on the webpage to hopefully sway fence-sitters. This will be dealt with on a page about construction.</p>

        <h3>Intended audience</h3>
        <p>The target group for the webpage largely consists of settled house-owners planning to use gabions for construction on their property. This poses another challenge with our website, as many people in this demographic are likely to be older, and not very familiar with computers. Due to this, our design needs to be fairly straightforward and simplistic. For instance, we should avoid hidden features such as dropdown menus and so forth.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>Beside the certain requirements about contents which will be described in the next paragraph, we have free reign. When we discussed requirements with the client he stated that he had no requirements or preferences in regards to organization of the contents or design choices, beyond the fact that it should be a user friendly webpage with a lot of pictures and embedded videos. Regardless, we will send different design and structure suggestions throughout the process to get the clients input on crucial matters. We also have a couple self-imposed goals that we want to try to accomplish:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We want to make the page as user-friendly as possible, as the site will mostly be used by grown-up people wanting to renovate/fresh up their gardens.</li>
          <li>We would also like to fill up the page with a lot of pictures. Gabions are a pretty obscure subject, and images will help to make the page visitors understand what a gabion actually is.</li>
          <li>We want to add videos to the tutorial page. We will ask our client to provide us with these videos.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Contents</h3>

        <p>Our initial plan is that the website will have five pages, but as we have free reign, if the need arises we might restructure small parts of the website if it seems beneficial.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Homepage
            <p>Our homepage will display various trivia about gabions, a lot of pictures of gabions so that the user understands what gabions even are, and possibly some videos. Our homepage needs to effectively inform the user about what gabions are, what they are used for.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Specifications
            <p>The specifications webpage will display various models of gabions and their respective specifications. This information will be featured in a table.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage examples
            <p>This webpage will display various ways of using gabions. This means that we will include many example usage cases of gabions - using text and images of gabions using in many different settings, we wish to inspire the user to use gabions in their next project.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Tutorials
            <p>The tutorials page will be devoted to the fine art of constructing using gabions. It will contain both written tutorials and video tutorials provided to us by Thorleif. The point of this page is to teach people how to construct using gabions, hopefully leading to more sales.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            About us
            <p>This webpage will contain contact information, the storage facilitys adress, phone numbers and other useful information about the company.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Server and hosting</h3>
        <p>Thorleif is already in posession of the domain gabionbutikken.no, which will be the domain used for the completed version of this website. Thorleif will provide the website hosting, and Kjell Østlid, an associate of Thorleif, will be maintaining the website.</p>
