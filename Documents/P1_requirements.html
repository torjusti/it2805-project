          <p id="profile-description">Our client is Thorleif Fluer Vikre. He owns and run the company Vikre Handel, which primarily deals with renting out and selling plastic warehouses. However, the business also branches out into the rental and sale of numerous other products. Our task is to create a website specifically aimed at selling gabions. Gabions are essentially metal crates you fill with various types of rocks, and stack to build decorative garden elements. Some examples are fences and benches.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>The goal of the website is to sell gabions to both determined customers and undetermined customers. Therefore it’s vital that the webpage is graphically pleasing to convince customers to buy gabions. We intend to accomplish this by including several pictures, in the form of slideshows, but also some independent pictures. In addition It’s essential to have good access to contact information and the address of the storage facility, as Vikre Handel does not support online billing and does not want to do so in the future. These goals will be realized on three pages, the homepage, a page about the uses of gabions and a contacts page. When the first step of deciding to buy gabions is concluded, the customer needs to decide what type of gabion to buy. Therefore there will be a page displaying the specifications of the different types. The hurdle of constructing the gabions might also seem intimidating at first, which is why we will implement instructions on how to construct the gabions on the webpage to hopefully sway fence-sitters. This will be dealt with on a page about construction.</p>

        <h3>Intended audience</h3>
        <p>The target group for the webpage largely consists of settled house-owners planning to use gabions for construction on their property. This poses another challenge with our website, as many people in this demographic are likely to be older, and not very familiar with computers. Due to this, our design needs to be fairly straightforward and simplistic. For instance, we should avoid “hidden” features such as dropdown menus and so forth.</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Beside the certain requirements about contents which will be described in the next paragraph, we have free reign. When we discussed requirements with the client he stated that he had no requirements or preferences in regards to organization of the contents or design choices. That is beside it being an user friendly webpage with a lot of pictures and embedded videos. Regardless, we will send different design and structure suggestions throughout the process to get the clients input on crucial matters.</p>

        <p>Our entire webpage will consist of at least five pages, but as we have free rains, if the need arises we will restructure if it seems beneficial. The homepage will display trivia, pictures and possibly some videos. The second webpage will display all the various models of gabions and their respective specifications. The third webpage will display various ways of using gabions. The fourth page will be devoted to the construction of gabions. It will contain tutorials with both video and picture. The fifth page will contain contact information, the storage facility’s address and other useful information about the company.</p>

        <h3>Server and hosting</h3>
        <p>Thorleif is already in posession of the domain gabionbutikken.no, which will be the domain used for the completed version of this website. Thorleif will provide the website hosting, and Kjell Østlid, an associate of Thorleif, will be maintaining the website.</p>
